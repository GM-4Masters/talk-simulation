# Team Introduction

Our team is one of the teams of [_GameMakers_](https://gamemakers.oopy.io/), undergraduate game developer club.
Although our main project about 2D side-scroll RPG Simulation Game over the past year failed, we decided to commemorate our team by creating this game in a hackathon style.
The story of the game is based on the our experiences, with some adaptations.
